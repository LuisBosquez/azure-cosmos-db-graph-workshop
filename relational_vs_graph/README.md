# Relational vs Graph Data Modeling

This scenario walks through the following business requirements in 4 steps/versions:
- Stage 1: Map all employees to their respective groups. Try to answer which employee belongs to which group.
- Stage 2: Add a requirement for any given employee to belong to any other group or groups. Try to answer which group contains which employee now. 
- Stage 3: Add a requirement to include super-groups (groups of groups). Try to answer which groups are under the super group.
- Stage 4: Add a requirement for added hierarchies on the same dataset. Try to answer which managers are under the Engineering group.
